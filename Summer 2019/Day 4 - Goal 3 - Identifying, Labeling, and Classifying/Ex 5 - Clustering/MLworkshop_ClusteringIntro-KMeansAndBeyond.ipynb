Arbitrary initiation, then retrieve all neighborhood information within distance ϵ.\n","2. If this point contains MinPts within ϵ neighborhood, cluster formation starts. Otherwise the point is labeled as noise. This point can be later found within the ϵ neighborhood of a different point and, thus can be made a part of the cluster.\n","3. points within the neighborhood of the first point become part of the cluster. So all the points found within ϵ neighborhood are added, along with their own ϵ neighborhood, if they themselves also contains MinPts within their ϵ neighborhood.\n","4.
