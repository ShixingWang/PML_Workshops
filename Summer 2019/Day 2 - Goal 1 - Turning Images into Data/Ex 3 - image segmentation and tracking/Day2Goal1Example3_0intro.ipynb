    "# Day 2 Exercise 3 - image segmentation and tracking\n",
    "\n",
    " ## What is Image Segmentation?\n",
    " Here is a definition quoted from Wikipedia:\n",
    " > In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as super-pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    " An image is a container full of data, in the form of pixels. The neat shape of an image makes it easy to process with tensor manipulation mathods, but this comes at a cost that the pixels not belonging to the objects of our interest also appear in the image. Image segmentation distinguishes the objects of our interest and \"segments\" objects and backgrounds into different super-pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    " Image segmentation attracted people's attention much earlier than the machine leanring got popular, so there have been effective methods without utilizing fancy machine learning methods, but AI really brings this topic to a higher level. For the same methods, there are different implements on different libraries. So this notebook will be organized into a two-level hierachy. The upper level introduces these segmentation methods, while the lower level talks about the codes calling the functions that really work. Here is the list:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Supervised (manual) segmentation\n",
    "   - scikit-image\n",
    " * Unsupervised segmentation\n",
    "   - scikit-image\n",
    " * Semantic segmentation\n",
    "   - TensorFlow\n",
    "   - PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " The contents of this notebook come from several online resources. They are listed in the [\"Further Reading\"](#Further-Reading) section, so that you can check them out in case you are not used to the arrangement of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Preliminary Packages\n",
    "\n",
    " Before the journey starts, make sure you have all the dependencies installed. They are listed below, with brief introductions and installation instructions. Most installations need a command-line interface (`cmd` or `powershell` in Windows, `bash` or any shell you like in Linux), and you need to restart this notebook after running the commands.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### scikit-image\n",
    "\n",
    " > An open-source image processing library for the Python programming language. It includes algorithms for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation, analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more. It is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. --Wikipedia\n",
